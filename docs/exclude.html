<p>Starting from version <strong>0.5.3</strong>, effluxpy accepts <strong>–exclude</strong> command line
arguments expecting linux filename expansion strings, also known as globs.</p>
<p><strong>Note (windows):</strong> on nt platforms, the accepted glob syntax will be the same
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/</span></code> for filepath separator and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\</span></code> used for character escapes),
effluxpy will transform them appropriately.</p>
<p>They allow matching filemames using wildcards, being the most common <cite>*</cite>
(matching any string, even empty) and <cite>?</cite> (matching a single character). See
<a class="reference internal" href="#glob-manpage"><span class="std std-ref">Glob manpage</span></a> for further info.</p>
<p>Please note that both collating symbols (like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[.a-acute.]</span></code>) and
equivalence class expressions (like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[=a=]</span></code>) are currently unsupported.</p>
<p>Excluded paths will be omitted from both directory listing and directory
tarball downloads.</p>
<p>As seen at <a class="reference internal" href="quickstart.html#quickstart-usage"><span class="std std-ref">Usage</span></a>, the exclude parameter can be provided
as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>effluxpy --exclude<span class="o">=</span>.*
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The above example will exclude all files prefixed with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.</span></code>, which are
considered hidden on POSIX systems. In other words, it will match <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.myfile</span></code>
and not <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">my.file</span></code>.</p>
<p>You can, alternatively, restrict the above exclusion to only top-level filenames:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>effluxpy --exclude<span class="o">=</span>/.*
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The following example will hide all files ending with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.ini</span></code>, but only on the
base directory.</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>effluxpy --exclude<span class="o">=</span>/*.ini
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You will find this syntax very similar to definitions found in <strong>.gitignore</strong>,
<strong>.dockerignore</strong> and others ignore definition files. As effluxpy uses
same format, you can pass them to effluxpy using <strong>–exclude-from</strong>
options.</p>

NAME
       glob - globbing pathnames

DESCRIPTION
       Long  ago,  in  UNIX V6, there was a program /etc/glob that
       would expand wildcard patterns.  Soon afterward this became
       a shell built-in.

       These  days  there  is  also a library routine glob(3) that
       will perform this function for a user program.

       The rules are as follows (POSIX.2, 3.13).

   Wildcard matching
       A string is a wildcard pattern if it contains  one  of  the
       characters &#39;?&#39;, &#39;*&#39; or &#39;[&#39;.  Globbing is the operation that
       expands a wildcard  pattern  into  the  list  of  pathnames
       matching the pattern.  Matching is defined by:

       A &#39;?&#39; (not between brackets) matches any single character.

       A  &#39;*&#39; (not between brackets) matches any string, including
       the empty string.

       Character classes

       An expression &quot;[...]&quot; where the first character  after  the
       leading  &#39;[&#39;  is  not  an  &#39;!&#39;  matches a single character,
       namely any of the characters enclosed by the brackets.  The
       string  enclosed by the brackets cannot be empty; therefore
       &#39;]&#39; can be allowed between the brackets, provided  that  it
       is  the  first character.  (Thus, &quot;[][!]&quot; matches the three
       characters &#39;[&#39;, &#39;]&#39; and &#39;!&#39;.)

       Ranges

       There is one special convention: two  characters  separated
       by  &#39;-&#39; denote a range.  (Thus, &quot;[A-Fa-f0-9]&quot; is equivalent
       to &quot;[ABCDEFabcdef0123456789]&quot;.)  One may include &#39;-&#39; in its
       literal  meaning  by  making it the first or last character
       between the brackets.  (Thus, &quot;[]-]&quot; matches just  the  two
       characters &#39;]&#39; and &#39;-&#39;, and &quot;[--0]&quot; matches the three char‐
       acters &#39;-&#39;, &#39;.&#39;, &#39;0&#39;, since &#39;/&#39; cannot be matched.)

       Complementation

       An expression &quot;[!...]&quot; matches a single  character,  namely
       any  character  that  is  not  matched  by  the  expression
       obtained  by  removing  the  first  &#39;!&#39;  from  it.   (Thus,
       &quot;[!]a-]&quot;  matches  any single character except &#39;]&#39;, &#39;a&#39; and
       &#39;-&#39;.)

       One can remove the special meaning of &#39;?&#39;, &#39;*&#39; and  &#39;[&#39;  by
       preceding  them by a backslash, or, in case this is part of
       a shell command line, enclosing them  in  quotes.   Between
       brackets  these  characters  stand  for  themselves.  Thus,
       &quot;[[?*\]&quot; matches the four characters &#39;[&#39;, &#39;?&#39;, &#39;*&#39; and &#39;\&#39;.

   Pathnames
       Globbing is applied on each of the components of a pathname
       separately.  A &#39;/&#39; in a pathname cannot be matched by a &#39;?&#39;
       or &#39;*&#39; wildcard, or by a range like &quot;[.-0]&quot;.  A range  con‐
       taining  an  explicit &#39;/&#39; character is syntactically incor‐
       rect.  (POSIX requires that  syntactically  incorrect  pat‐
       terns are left unchanged.)

       If  a  filename  starts  with a &#39;.&#39;, this character must be
       matched explicitly.  (Thus, rm * will not remove  .profile,
       and  tar c *  will  not  archive all your files; tar c . is
       better.)

   Empty lists
       The nice and simple rule given above:  &quot;expand  a  wildcard
       pattern into the list of matching pathnames&quot; was the origi‐
       nal UNIX definition.  It allowed one to have patterns  that
       expand into an empty list, as in

           xv -wait 0 *.gif *.jpg

       where  perhaps  no *.gif files are present (and this is not
       an error).  However, POSIX requires that a wildcard pattern
       is  left  unchanged  when it is syntactically incorrect, or
       the list of matching pathnames is empty.  With bash one can
       force the classical behavior using this command:

           shopt -s nullglob

       (Similar  problems occur elsewhere.  For example, where old
       scripts have

           rm `find . -name &quot;*~&quot;`

       new scripts require

           rm -f nosuchfile `find . -name &quot;*~&quot;`

       to avoid error messages from rm called with an empty  argu‐
       ment list.)

NOTES
   Regular expressions
       Note  that  wildcard  patterns are not regular expressions,
       although they are a bit similar.  First of all, they  match
       filenames,  rather than text, and secondly, the conventions
       are not the same: for example, in a regular expression  &#39;*&#39;
       means zero or more copies of the preceding thing.

       Now that regular expressions have bracket expressions where
       the negation is indicated by a &#39;^&#39;, POSIX has declared  the
       effect of a wildcard pattern &quot;[^...]&quot; to be undefined.

   Character classes and internationalization
       Of  course ranges were originally meant to be ASCII ranges,
       so that &quot;[ -%]&quot; stands for &quot;[ !&quot;#$%]&quot;  and  &quot;[a-z]&quot;  stands
       for &quot;any lowercase letter&quot;.  Some UNIX implementations gen‐
       eralized this so that a range X-Y stands  for  the  set  of
       characters  with  code  between  the codes for X and for Y.
       However, this requires the user to know the character  cod‐
       ing in use on the local system, and moreover, is not conve‐
       nient if the collating sequence for the local alphabet dif‐
       fers  from the ordering of the character codes.  Therefore,
       POSIX extended the bracket notation greatly, both for wild‐
       card patterns and for regular expressions.  In the above we
       saw three types of  items  that  can  occur  in  a  bracket
       expression:  namely  (i) the negation, (ii) explicit single
       characters, and (iii) ranges.  POSIX specifies ranges in an
       internationally more useful way and adds three more types:

       (iii)  Ranges X-Y comprise all characters that fall between
       X and Y (inclusive) in the current  collating  sequence  as
       defined by the LC_COLLATE category in the current locale.

       (iv) Named character classes, like

       [:alnum:]  [:alpha:]  [:blank:]  [:cntrl:]
       [:digit:]  [:graph:]  [:lower:]  [:print:]
       [:punct:]  [:space:]  [:upper:]  [:xdigit:]

       so  that  one can say &quot;[[:lower:]]&quot; instead of &quot;[a-z]&quot;, and
       have things work in Denmark, too,  where  there  are  three
       letters  past &#39;z&#39; in the alphabet.  These character classes
       are defined by the LC_CTYPE category in the current locale.

       (v) Collating  symbols,  like  &quot;[.ch.]&quot;  or  &quot;[.a-acute.]&quot;,
       where  the string between &quot;[.&quot; and &quot;.]&quot; is a collating ele‐
       ment defined for the current locale.  Note that this may be
       a multicharacter element.

       (vi) Equivalence class expressions, like &quot;[=a=]&quot;, where the
       string between &quot;[=&quot; and &quot;=]&quot; is any collating element  from
       its  equivalence  class, as defined for the current locale.
       For example, &quot;[[=a=]]&quot; might be  equivalent  to  &quot;[aáàäâ]&quot;,
       that  is,  to &quot;[a[.a-acute.][.a-grave.][.a-umlaut.][.a-cir‐
       cumflex.]]&quot;.
